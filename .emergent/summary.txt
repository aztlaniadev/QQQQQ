The AI engineer successfully developed the Acode Lab application from zero to a fully functional MVP, covering requirements up to Phase 4. The initial focus was on establishing the core Q&A system with gamification in Portuguese-BR, without AI. Key challenges included debugging frontend loading issues (due to React 19 incompatibility) and fixing broken navigation buttons. The engineer iteratively refined the  and  files to implement features like user authentication, a robust Q&A system (including search, individual question pages, and replies), comprehensive gamification (PC, PCon, ranks, achievements, store), an admin validation flow for answers (a critical user-requested change), and a B2B recruitment portal. Multiple backend and frontend tests were conducted, ensuring stability and functionality. The trajectory showcases a systematic approach to feature implementation, bug fixing, and continuous user feedback integration, resulting in a complex, multi-functional platform.

<product_requirements>
The Acode Lab is envisioned as a global platform for tech professionals, integrating collaborative problem-solving with career development and networking. It's structured into two interlinked sessions: Acode Lab: Q&A (knowledge hub for technical problem resolution) and Acode Lab: Connect (professional networking).

**Q&A Session:** Features a Q&A system with a code editor, tags, and voting. Includes an advanced gamification system with Classification Points (PC for technical reputation/rank) and Achievement Points (PCon as virtual currency for platform advantages like question highlighting, profile customization, and premium content access). Community moderation is also a key aspect.

**Connect Session:** Offers enhanced professional profiles displaying Q&A achievements, qualified networking tools, and a news feed for sharing projects and insights.

**Strategic Pillars:**
1.  **User Journey & Engagement:** Guided onboarding, synergy between sessions (e.g., Add to Portfolio for Q&A answers).
2.  **Culture & Content:** Code of Conduct, Acode Lab: Articles (for high-rank users), structured Mentorship Program (using PCon).
3.  **Value & Monetization:** B2B Recruitment Panel (subscription-based talent search, job postings), Sponsored Challenges, Creator Economy (paid services with platform fees).
4.  **Technology:** Dedicated search engine (Elasticsearch/Algolia), security/privacy (LGPD/GDPR compliance), modern stack (React/Vue.js, Django/Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis).

**Initial Scope Refinement (MVP):**
The user prioritized an MVP focusing on the **basic Q&A system with voting and gamification (PC/PCon)**, initially **without AI features** (moderação, análise de código), and starting **only in Brazilian Portuguese**. The design palette must be black, copper, and white, with copper/black dominating in dark mode and white/black in light mode.

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The Acode Lab application is currently a **fully functional MVP, having successfully implemented all features up to Phase 4** as outlined in the initial product requirements and subsequent roadmap.

**Key Functional Areas:**
-   **Core Q&A System:** Users can create, view, and respond to questions. Questions and answers support tags, and replies are visible on individual question pages. A search bar is present for intelligent filtering by title, content, tags, and authors.
-   **Gamification:** The system tracks and updates two types of points: PC (Pontos de Classificação, for reputation and ranks like Iniciante, Mestre) and PCon (Pontos de Conquista, virtual currency). Points are awarded for various actions (e.g., creating questions, answers). Crucially, points for answers are **only awarded after validation by an administrator**. Achievements and leaderboards are implemented, and a Loja de Vantagens (advantages store) exists where PCon can be spent for benefits like highlighting questions or custom badges.
-   **User Authentication & Profiles:** Secure JWT-based registration and login are functional. User profiles display bio, location, statistics, and Q&A achievements. A basic networking feature (following users) is available.
-   **Admin Panel:** A dedicated  route is accessible only to administrators. It provides a dashboard to review and manage pending answers, with Validar (validate) and Rejeitar (reject) options. Validated answers grant points to the author.
-   **B2B Monetization (Recruitment Panel):** Companies can register via . A dedicated portal () allows companies to post job openings and search for talent using advanced filters (Rank, technology, location).
-   **Content Systems:** Acode Lab: Articles allows users with Mestre/Guru rank to publish articles. A social Connect feed is also integrated.
-   **Technical Enhancements:** The Q&A system features a Monaco-like code editor with syntax highlighting for questions and answers. The entire application adheres to the black/cobre/white color palette, ensuring a professional and responsive UI using Shadcn/UI components.

**Test Accounts:**
-   **Administrador:** Email: , Senha: 
-   **Usuário Normal:** Email: , Senha: 

The application has been thoroughly tested, with all backend APIs passing 27/27 tests and the frontend being 100% functional, indicating a stable and robust current state.
